# BitJan
BitJan is a new gen cryptocurrency for smart contracts
## Abstract
BitJan is a multi purpose coin and it has couple of goals:
- It must be fast, transactions should be handled as soon as possible
- It must be cheap, it should not have any transaction fee
- It must be reliable and attackproof
- It also must be a good financial asset for storing value and be a good investment to take attention
- It must be easy to use
- It must be a platform for smart contracts

## No transaction fee
Most of the cryptocurrencies use miners to verify the transactions. They should keep verifying them so they get block rewards. So people needs to pay fee for the miners.
BitJan doesn't have miners, instead every node verifys the transactions. Because of this, users doesn't need to pay fee to send BitJan tokens. This is also a more environment-friendly solution, because nobody doesn't have to race to solve a mathematical problem to win a block.

## Security
BitJan doesn't have miners, so anybody doesn't add their block to the network. Everyone verifys them one by one. So nobody can do a %51 attack to the network.

## Deflation
BitJan doesn't need transaction fee but in order to be a good investmen option, we have deflation. So when someone send some Jan, %1 of it gets burned automatically. But what is the meaning of being a non-transaction fee coin then? We also have another coin called WJan. If somebody wants to hold their Jans to store their values, they can hold jans. But if they wants to send it without fee, they can transform their Jans to WJans. Wjan doesn't have any transaction fee. And they can't be turned back to Jans. So Jan supply will always decrease and its value will increase. Also in order to deploy a smart contract, users will need Jans. But sending tokens doesn't require any transaction fee and it will be completely free.

## Smart Contracts
Programmers can develop smart contracts to deploy new tokens on the network. Deploying a new token requires Jan. But transfering the tokens is free. This makes BitJan is the most suitable network for tokens.

## Structure

- We use NodeJs for backend.
- Front-end will be handled with html5,css,javascript
- Transactions will be delivered and stored with Json data
- We use ExpressJs to serve files
- We use MongoDB as database
- We use EJS as Template engine

## Libraries
List of the libraries we use:
- Jquery
- Mongoose
- EJS
